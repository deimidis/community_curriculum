### Introduction

> ####en·voy
>ˈenˌvoi,ˈänˌvoi/
>noun
> noun: envoy; plural noun: envoys
> 
> 1. **a messenger or representative, especially one on a diplomatic mission.**
> 
> **synonyms**:	ambassador, emissary, diplomat, consul, attaché, chargé d'affaires, plenipotentiary; 

As community leaders, it's important to explore what our own responsibilities are in responding to concerns, complaints, misconceptions and challenges from within the community, but also well beyond in conversations we have as envoys of Mozilla in technical communities more broadly.

For fun, this activity helps the visualization of networked action at Mozilla.  

## Activity - Introductions 

Even the smallest misconception can have rippling and negative impacts on our mission, and perception of our work.  As existing and emerging leaders you have the influence and the network at Mozilla to bring clarity, understanding and new Mozillians by leveraging the networks of support in the community.  

**Scenerio**

> You have spoken at, or attended an event where someone approached you with a question about a Mozilla product you cannot answer with accuracy, but the question is important - especially because this person is indicating they will blog on the topic.  You ask for, and take this person's contact information for follow-up.

Going around in an introduction, ask each person to state their name and to describe their primary network for outreach. For each of those people have them 'describe' that person's identity within the network with non-Mozilla words. 

**Banned Words**

* Mozilla Rep
* Staff or Staff Role
* Volunteer
* Contributor
* Boss


### Six Degrees of Mitchell Baker - Community (10 minutes )

> How might this Mozillian connect to Mitchell Baker on issues that matter to them?

This fast paced activity, asks people(in small groups) to run through of of the 10 Mozillian names, map their pathways to Mitchell Baker using a shared document.  This means they envision how this person would most likely pass along a personal or private message to Mitchell without using distribution lists or direct email.  Maps contain the following:

1. Person's Name
2. Degree # and why
3. Secondary Degree : If you came to a fork in the road a choice between two directions why you chose this one.
4. Whether this person is a decision maker or an influencer.
5. Mitchell Baker

### Six Degrees of Mitchell Baker - Developer Communities (10 minutes)

Using the Random Challenge Generator  write a detailed story of how you would respond to that challenge that covers these points:

1. Privacy for the person asking the question (no tweeting for questions).
2. Reflecting the urgency of whether the person needs clarity, resolution or answers. 
2. Includes feedback for Mozilla that matters to strategy and mission.
3. A clear, accurate response for the person asking the question.
4. What pathway you see to Mitchell should that be appropriate.


### Discussion

1.  In this process, what became clearer or foggier about the networks of staff, alumni and volunteer networks?
2. What types of networks emerge as you went through this?
3. How does this influence your confidence to be the primary route of escalation and resolution for community concerns?
4. In the second exercise did you ever stop with yourself as the primary person for information and resolution? Why or why not?
