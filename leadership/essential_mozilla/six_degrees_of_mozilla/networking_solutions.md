### Introduction

> ####en·voy
>ˈenˌvoi,ˈänˌvoi/
>noun
> noun: envoy; plural noun: envoys
> 
> 1. **a messenger or representative, especially one on a diplomatic mission.**
> 
> **synonyms**:	ambassador, emissary, diplomat, consul, attaché, chargé d'affaires, plenipotentiary; 

As community leaders, it's important to feel empowered to use existing networks of Mozillians to help address concerns, complaints, misconceptions and challenges from within the community, but also well beyond in conversations we have as envoys of Mozilla in technical communities more broadly.

## Ice Breaker
  
Ask people to introduce themselves, and provide a description (need not be name) of first person they would reach out to in the Mozilla community if they needed help obtaining information, or sought help with a problem and hwy. Ask them to describe that person without using the banned words below. 

**Banned Words**

* Mozilla Rep
* Staff 
* Volunteer
* Contributor
* Boss
* Alumni

#### Wrap Up

Use the opportunity to introduce the idea that  no matter our roles in the community, there exists the same pathways to find help, answers and receive feedback - whether you are a volunteer or staff member. 

We are also be the creators of new networks as leaders.

Being a staff member is not the same as being a decision maker.

### Introduction - "Degree"

For the purposes of this game, a 'degree' is that by which someone has the 'ear' of someone in the community who can provide accurate answers, or connect to someone else who can.  T.

* Interacts with regularly 1:1
* Reports to that person on the org chart
* Is in a mentor/mentee relationship in Reps or any other similar.
* Participates in the same functional area, and have daily knowledge of each other's abilities and value.


## Visualizing Networks

This fast paced activity, asks people(in small groups) to run through of of the 10 Mozillian names, map their pathways to someone who can make a decision using a shared document.  This means they envision how this person would most likely pass along a personal or private message to Mitchell without using distribution lists or direct email.  Each person in your map should include the following:

1. Person's Name
2. Whether this person is a decision maker or an influencer.

### Six Degrees of Mozilla  - Developer Communities (10 minutes)

Using the Random Challenge Generator  write a detailed story of how you would respond to that challenge that covers these points:

0. Clarification - getting the question right.
1. Privacy for the person asking the question (no tweeting for questions).
2. Reflecting the urgency of whether the person needs clarity, resolution or answers. 
2. Includes feedback for Mozilla that matters to strategy and mission.
3. A clear, accurate response for the person asking the question.


### Discussion

1.  In this process, what became clearer or foggier about the networks of staff, alumni and volunteer networks?
2. What types of networks emerge as you went through this?
3. How does this influence your confidence to be the primary route of escalation and resolution for community concerns?
4. In the second exercise did you ever stop with yourself as the primary person for information and resolution? Why or why not?
