#Interviews

For each set of questions below ask partners to interview each other for one minute each, drawing out and documenting thoughts,  ideas and even hunches about what might benefit this Mozillian in thinking about their desire pathway for participation at Mozilla.

## Mozillian Strengths

Thinking about a contribution, and activity, a collaboration - anything that relates back to Mozilla that you have participated in, or learned and answer these questions.

* **Q1** What activities at Mozilla, or on behalf of Mozilla can you not wait to start?
* **Q2** What part of the project offers opportunities you can't wait to get to?
* **Q4** What skill, knowledge or attitude are you most hoping to grow as part of your contributor work at Mozilla?

## Future Strengths

* **Q1** What Impact would you most like to have on the Mozilla project and it's mission?
* **Q2** What influence do you want to have on the goals of others at Mozilla?
* **Q3** What personal goals do you have for your education, or professionally?


## Categorize

Ask participants to take two minutes each to categorize what you've learned about their partners, into themes.  

# Starting Points and Destinations

Ask participants to draw out from the conversations where they are right now.  What represents this place in time for the participant, and then looking at the themes in their participation look for a goal that can be reached in a year.   Use the desire pathway template to plot these as starting and end points.

## Desire Pathways - Step by Step

Using this example ask participants to plot six steps that will bring them  closer to their destination.

## Discussion

1. What part of your current participation at Mozilla are missing from your desire pathway?
2. What part of your desire pathway includes things you haven't tried before or involve new learning?
3. How do you think investing in this type of pathway can benefit you?  Benefit Mozilla?

# Super Hero Pledge

Based on desire pathways and discussion wrap up by asking participants to fill in the Mozilla Super Hero Pledge as a guide moving forward (and yes they may share on social media if they want).
