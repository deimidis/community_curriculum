#A Bold Leap - Building your Community Credentials

This workshop will facilitate a connection to your authentic Mozillian self while exploring your identity beyond the community as a technical ambassador. How you can lead more confidently, develop your credibility in the larger tech community.

Using the findings from our interview series, we'll design credentials that feel honest and powerful to the participant when visualizing their success speaking on behalf of Mozilla.

These credentials are affirmation of what the participant has shared about their strengths and ambitions, but also a reflection of their potential.
