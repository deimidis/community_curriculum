## Shift Your Thinking to Coach Effectively

### Growth mind set

A growth mind-set can feel risky because it forces you, the coach, to develop skills of your own that go beyond subject-matter expertise. You must ask questions and really listen without jumping in to provide what you believe is the “right” answer.

### Reconciling intent and impact

You can gauge an employee’s impact on the organization by observing him in action and using performance metrics such as satisfaction surveys and sales figures. But you won’t know his intent—the driving force behind his behavior—unless he shares it with you.

Coaching them effectively involves clarifying their intent so that you can close that gap. How? By asking them what impact they meant to have. For instance, you might say to someone, “You were quiet at the last sales meeting—can we talk about why?” You and others may have viewed his silence as resistance or disengagement, but perhaps he was just trying to cede the floor for a change, knowing that he can be domineering in group discussions.

As a rule of thumb, ask more than you tell—aim for a ratio of about 4:1. If you flip that ratio, you’re teaching, not coaching.

Coaching is an interactive opportunity to discover and create previously unknown solutions.

Always assume positive intent, even when dealing with difficult behavior.

### Recognizing your biases

Your own preferences can get in the way of discovering others’ intent. Maybe you have a gut reaction against certain personality types or struggle to identify with colleagues whose work styles differ from yours. Whatever your biases, recognizing them allows you to move past them by inquiring about intent rather than jumping to conclusions or filling in the blanks.

To spot your biases, use frustration as your guide. Think about what gets on your nerves at work and then ask a few trusted colleagues for feedback.

### Matching people’s skills with big-picture needs

As a coach to your employees, you’re not just helping them grow for their own sake—noble as that is. You’re also boosting their ability to support the company’s mission and goals. By explicitly connecting their skills with big-picture needs, you’ll give them a sense of purpose and belonging, which will motivate them to grow.

How can you get better at connecting the dots between their skills and the organization’s needs? There’s no magic here—again, you’ll get a wealth of information simply by asking. Where do they feel their skills are best used? What excites them about their work? What areas do they struggle with? What would they like to do more of? Less of?

Developing a growth mind-set means you’re learning right along with your employees. The more coaching practice you get, the sharper your skills will become—but give yourself a running start by favoring inquiry over advocacy. Ask questions about others’ intent, your own biases, and individuals’ place in the big picture. And resist the temptation to coach by explaining how you do things.

## Set the Stage to Stimulate Growth

### Achieving Peak Performance

**Step 1: Select**

Help them achieve peak performance by selecting tasks (1) that they are good at; (2) that they like to do; and (3) that add value to the project or organization. The intersection of those three elements creates the magical field in which consistent excellence can happen.

**Step 2: Play**

By valuing and promoting play, you can transform your employees’ performance. Here are some ways to encourage people to leap from the humdrum to the exceptional:

1. *Ask open-ended questions*. The Socratic method remains one of the best ways to teach. Instead of giving answers, ask questions that engage the imagination, invite people to brainstorm and reflect, and help them make discoveries.

2. *Model a questioning attitude*. Show people that it is safe to disagree with the party line and with the boss—that it is in fact good to bring up opposing points of view.

**Step 3: Shine**

As your employees work hard and advance, they’ll gain recognition—which affirms the value of what they’ve accomplished. Help them shine by praising and rewarding them for a job well executed. People who shine are motivated. They feel connected and extremely loyal to the team, the group, and the organization. They want to keep shining, and they want to help others shine, too.
