## Questionnaire before the first meeting

1. What are you best at doing? (Can you think of ways to incorporate more of what you do best into your work in Mozilla?)
2. What do you most like to do? (This is not always the same as what you do best.)
3. What do you wish you were better at? (This may be a skill you can develop through coaching or a task you should delegate.)
4. What talents do you have that you haven’t developed? (Don’t say “none.” Everyone has bundles of them. Pick a few. Just because you name them doesn’t mean you have to develop them.)
5. What skills are you most proud of? (This may reflect obstacles you have overcome.)
6. What do others say are your greatest strengths? (This question is designed to help you identify skills you may not value because they seem easy to you.)
7. What have you gotten better at that you used to be bad at? (This gives you an idea of where putting in additional effort can pay off.)
8. What are you just not getting better at, no matter how hard you try? (This tells you where you shouldn’t waste more time.)
9. What do you most dislike doing? (Your answer here suggests what tasks you might want to delegate or hire out.)
10. The lack of which skills most gets in your way? (If you lack a skill required in your current work in Mozilla and you can’t delegate it, then that is getting in your way. Your answer to this question might lead you to take a course, read a book, or work with a coach.)
11. What sorts of people do you work best and worst with? (Do you hate to work with highly organized analytic types, or do you love it? Do creative types drive you crazy, or do you work well with them? Make up your own categories.)
12. What sort of organizational culture brings out the best in you? (It’s amazing how many people won’t leave a culture they are hideously unsuited to work in.)
13. What were you doing when you were happiest in your Mozilla's life? (Could you find a way to incorporate that into what you’re doing now?)
16. What are you most proud of in your Mozilla's life? (Your answer here is another tip-off as to what you should be doing.)
17. What one lesson about managing your Mozilla's career would you pass along to the next generation? (This question is another way of getting at your thoughts on what you have done, what’s worked, and what hasn’t.)
19. What lesson did the best boss you ever had teach you about yourself? (Other people often know us better than we do.)
20. How could your time be better used in your current work to add value to the organization? (Your answer here gives your manager valuable input he or she may never have asked for.)
