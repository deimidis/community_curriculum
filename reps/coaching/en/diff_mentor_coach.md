# Differences between Mentor and Coach

> "There is a great man who makes every man feel small. But the real great man is the man who makes every man feel great." --G.K. Chesterton

The difference between “mentors” and “coaches” may not seem obvious. In fact, most people don’t even realize there is a distinction between the two.

A **coach** focuses on short-term development, with emphasis on enhancing current skills or on acquiring new skills. A **coach** does not share their personal concerns or experience, but rather proposes methods to enhance the *coachee's* understanding of their own self.

*Coachee* generally know what is the right or appropriate thing to do. Often your job is to **draw the answer out of the individual**. If you give the person the answer, she/he is less likely to own and fully enroll in the solution or answer.

Good coaches create a safe space to have an open discussion, ask the right questions (and genuinely listen to the answers), and constructively challenge.

When you coach, you aren’t just comparing stated objectives with a list of accomplishments. You’re helping people better understand the consequences of their actions and see when there is a disconnect between what they wanted to accomplish and what actually happened. It requires you be able to put yourself in their shoes and interpret various situations.

At a **Reps** level, we are changing the way that we work before. Rather than *helping* your mentee with her/his budget request, we want that you help your peers to challenge themselves to be better and have a personal development meanwhile they help Mozilla's mission.

Generally, a **coach/coachee** relationship is focus only on *personal development*. But we are working on Mozilla's context, so we will working not only on their skills, but how those skills function inside the organization and help advance the mission.
