# The myths of coaching

*There are five major myths surrounding what it takes to be a good coach. Here’s an attempt to set the record straight*.

Let’s face it, coaching is not about being a ‘nice guy’. It’s about bringing the same structure and creativity to your interactions with colleagues as you bring to solving business problems.

But before we go any further in defining what it takes to be a good coach, let’s address some of coaching’s myths and realities.

## Myth: We coach primarily to help others.

**Reality: There are many tangible, selfish and acceptable reasons to become a great coach**. In fact, good coaches find the personal payoffs so high that they rarely kick the habit. The following – listed in order of decreasing selfishness – is a sample of those payoffs:

* More time for yourself. You can either go home earlier or invest the time in higher quality work. While it’s virtually impossible to prove, most great coaches believe that investing just ten minutes a day in coaching team mates typically generates at least 20 minutes of extra time per day for the coach.
* Better customer relations skills. By coaching colleagues you can hone the interpersonal skills which you need for building effective relations with customers and clients.
* Stronger organisation. If you plan on a long term career with the company, investing in the development of your colleagues is clearly worthwhile.
* More fun. You and others work ing in coaching-oriented teams tend to enjoy yourselves more.
* Stronger following. If you help others, they tend to help you. And if you aspire to be a leader, it’s worth remembering that every leader needs a following.

## Myth: Focus on the coachee.

**Reality: Know thyself**. Coaches don’t focus exclusively on the coachee. In fact, great coaches have a high degree of self awareness. We all have the basic skills to coach; unfortunately, most of us have a few psychological blocks when it comes to applying those skills well and consistently. Great coaches know how to overcome their own blocks.

## Myth: Coaching equals feedback.

**Reality: There are many other important coaching tools and habits**. While most people think that coaching is merely providing feedback and suggestion to coachees, the truth is that insightful feedback is only one tool in the coach’s tool box. For example, good coaches typically master the art of effective questioning. Coachees can often learn more from a coach asking ‘How well do you think you did; what might you do differently next time?’, than from being told, ‘Here’s what you did wrong, and here’s what to do next time’. There are also other tools, like the GROW approach and motivation techniques.

## Myth: Coaching requires lots of time.

**Reality: The best coaching comes in small doses**. Many people believe that coaching comes in large quantums. But with a bit of practice, you don’t need to change into a jogging suit every time you want to provide coaching. Small investments of time – as little as five minutes – can yield tangible increases in performance.

## Myth: Coaching is about work.

**Reality: Good coaching will spread to other areas of life**. Those who develop their coaching skills at work usually find they are better able to help their friends, partners and children. In that respect, coaching is clearly a life skill.
