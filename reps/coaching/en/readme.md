# A mozillian guide to coaching

This is a Guide made by editing and curating content found on the web and books that will be distributed to Mozillians beginning in their Coach journey. The goal of this program is give some *Coach tools* to Mozillians that will help others Mozillians. We will be adding more resources from time to time.

Also, this Guide will have connections with the **Personal Leadership Framework** that we are developing in the Participation Team.
