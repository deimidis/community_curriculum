# Structuring the coaching session: GROW

So, how do we actually structure a coaching session? The **GROW** (**G**oal, **R**eality, **O**ptions, **W**rap up) model is one of the most common coaching tools, widely used by many great coaches.

The framework provides a simple four step structure for a coaching session. During the first step of a session [Goal], coach and coachee agree on a specific topic and objective for the discussion. During the second step [Reality], both coach and coachee invite self assessment and offer specific examples to illustrate their points. They then move into the third step [Options], where suggestions are offered and choices made. And finally [Wrap up], the coach and coachee commit to action, define a timeframe for their objectives and identify how to overcome possible obstacles.

Here are a few tips for using this model:

* Use more ‘ask’ than ‘tell’; elicit useful ideas from your coachee – don’t just try to prove you are smart
* Think creatively – not just systematically, particularly in the Options and Wrap up steps
* Illustrate, and check understanding, throughout by using specific examples – from the coachee’s and your own experiences
* If you have a follow up session, you can obviously lengthen or shorten each of the four steps as needed

## The Grow Model

* Agree topic for discussion
* Agree specific objective of session
* Set long-term aim if appropriate

Each session could begin with a check in on what happen since the last meeting, what happen with decisions made, etc.
