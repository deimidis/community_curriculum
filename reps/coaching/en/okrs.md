## OKRs (Objective and Key Results)

OKR is an abbreviation for Objective & Key Result. The concept was invented at the Intel Corporation and is widely used amongst the biggest technology companies in the world including Google and Zynga.

OKRs are meant to set strategy and goals over a specified amount of time for an organization and teams. At the end of a work period, your OKRs provide a reference to evaluate how well you did in executing your objectives.

Spending a concerted effort in identifying your company strategy and laying it out in a digestible way with OKRs can truly help your employees see how they are contributing to the big picture and align with other teams.

### Objective

> What do I want to get done.

The goal of setting an objective is to write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching, that objective.

Great objectives are:

* Qualitative and inspiring
* Time bound
* Actionable by me

### Key results

> How you know if you met your objective

Key Results are numerically-based expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.

The important element here is measuring success. It’s not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well you are succeeding. Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.

Great Key Results are:

* Metrics
* Quantity/quality balance
* Difficult, not impossible

### Conclusions

*How many OKRs should I have?*

The idea is not quantity, but quality of OKRs. Think about the key things you need to do to further your business, goals, or ideas and put the focus there. Also, not all Key Results are created equal. In more sophisticated OKR sets they can range from ‘must have’ to ‘nice to have.’

OKRs are meant to help you communicate with your company on how to move forward and win. The better you understand your goals and how to get there the more effective and precise your objectives will be — and same with your outcomes.
