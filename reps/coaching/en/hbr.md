By explicitly connecting their skills with big-picture needs, you’ll give them a sense of purpose and belonging, which will motivate them to grow.

Ask questions about others’ intent, your own biases, and individuals’ place in the big picture. And resist the temptation to coach by explaining how you do things.


A growth mind-set can feel risky because it forces you, the coach, to develop skills of your own that go beyond subject-matter expertise. You must ask questions and really listen without jumping in to provide what you believe is the “right” answer. And you must be honest about the performance you

Help them achieve peak performance by selecting tasks (1) that they are good at; (2) that they like to do; and (3) that add value to the project or organization. The intersection of those three elements creates the magical field in which consistent excellence can happen

As a rule of thumb, ask more than you tell—aim for a ratio of about 4:1. If you flip that ratio, you’re teaching, not coaching.

Listen intently; these first meetings aren’t about you telling your employees what you expect, or giving them feedback; instead, it’s for them to tell you about themselves, how they want to grow, and how they see the organization.

But by opening your session with a question, you begin as you’ll hope to continue: with your employee talking, you listening, and with both of you then building solutions together

While you’re both still in the room, agree on when to check in again, and identify any tasks to be completed before then

While still in the coaching meeting itself, set clear agreements about how you will move forward. Address the followin

Action items. Agree on the specific actions that you and your direct report will take between sessions.

Feedback.

Agreeing on how you will proceed and being clear about the frequency of your involvement between sessions will prevent your direct reports from being unnecessarily stressed or frustrated by well-intentioned check-ins. You will also want to decide whether others in the organization will play a role in offering feedback throughout the coaching process.

Resource needs.

Ask your employee what tools or support may be helpful. He may need specific learning resources, such as articles, books, assessments, or training programs.

Follow up on agreements.

If you don’t follow up on those agreements, however, your direct report is less likely to take them seriously. Periodically reviewing the written plan will hold everyone accountable:

*Check in directly*. Employees can get stuck between sessions; a new behavior may not work as hoped, or they may get frustrated with the ups and downs of the learning process. A simple check-in can get them unstuck and moving forward again.

*Communicate impact*. As you see your direct report begin to change and grow, communicate the impact of his growth to him explicitly: It may be harder for him to see.
Although much of the follow-up process focuses on your direct report, the process also requires self-reflection on your part.

1. Am I meeting the needs of this employee? The coaching process will look and feel different for each of your direct reports, and what works for one employee may not work for another. Approach the process with a trial-and-error mentality, and show openness in making adjustments along the way.

2. Am I holding up my end of the bargain? Assisting with the development of others can often expose your own strengths and weaknesses.

Coaching can be a challenging and yet uplifting process for both direct report and manager as you watch your employee grow and add value to the organization in new and different ways.

People don’t trust the praise. Before delivering unpleasant feedback to your direct reports, do you say something nice to soften the blow? Many of us do—and we unwittingly condition people to hear our positive feedback as a hollow preamble to the real message

**THE PITFALLS OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK**

Praise is supposed to make your employees feel good and motivate them, but often it does just the opposite. Here are three common problems and ways to avoid them:

 1. People don’t trust the praise. Before delivering unpleasant feedback to your direct reports, do you say something nice to soften the blow? Many of us do—and we unwittingly condition people to hear our positive feedback as a hollow preamble to the real message. Rather than feeling genuinely appreciated, they’re waiting for the other shoe to drop. Though we’ve diminished our anxiety about bearing bad news, we haven’t helped them receive it. We’ve actually undermined our ability to deliver any meaningful feedback, positive or negative. **What to do**: Instead of giving a spoonful of sugar before every dose of constructive criticism, lead off with your investment in the relationship and your reasons for having the conversation. For example: “It’s important that we can be candid and direct with each other so we can work together effectively. I have some concerns for us to discuss, and I’m optimistic that we can resolve them.”

 2. People resent it. Managers also use positive feedback to overcome resistance to requests. This age-old tactic can work in the moment but carries a long-term cost. It creates a sense of obligation, a “social debt” the recipient feels compelled to repay by acceding to your wishes. But if you train people to always expect requests after your praise, they’ll eventually feel manipulated and resentful—and less inclined to help you out. **What to do**: Motivate people over the long term by expanding your persuasive tool kit. As Jay Conger explains in his classic article “The Necessary Art of Persuasion” (HBR May–June 1998), you can gain lasting influence in four ways: establish credibility through expertise and work you’ve done in others’ interests, frame goals around common ground and shared advantage, support your views with compelling data and examples, and connect emotionally with people so they’ll be more receptive to your message.

 3. We praise the wrong things. When aimed at the wrong targets, praise does more harm than good. As Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck notes in a January 2012 HBR IdeaCast interview, “The whole self-esteem movement taught us erroneously that praising intelligence, talent, and abilities would foster self-confidence and self-esteem, and every thing great would follow. But we’ve found it backfires. People who are praised for talent now worry about doing the next thing, about taking on the hard task, and not looking talented, tarnishing that reputation for brilliance. So they’ll stick to their comfort zones and get really defensive when they hit setbacks.” **What to do**: Praise effort, not ability. Dweck suggests focusing on “the strategies, the doggedness and persistence, the grit and resilience” that people exhibit when facing challenges. And explain exactly what actions prompted your praise. If you’re vague or generic, you’ll fail to reinforce the desired behavior.

staying on our side of the net”—that is, focusing our feedback on our feelings about the behavior and avoiding references to the other person’s motives. We’re in safe territory on our side of the net; others may not like what we say when we describe how we feel, but they can’t dispute its accuracy. However, when we make guesses about their motives, we cross over to their side of the net, and even minor inaccuracies can provoke a defensive reaction.



Have feedback conversations more often

Even a two-minute debrief with an employee after a meeting or a presentation can be a useful learning opportunity for both of you.

Ask for feedback yourself.

Encouraging a growth mind-set doesn’t mean simply offering praise and avoiding criticism; it means focusing your feedback—both positive and negative—on employees’ efforts to accomplish their goals, not on their inherent abilities.

So when an employee seeks your support, start by asking questions, not giving answers.

Use “Why . . .” questions with care. Asking people why they did something can help them step back and reassess their approach, but it can also trigger defensive rationalization. That’s less likely to happen with “How . . .” and “What . . .” questions such as “How do you feel about what happened?” and “What would you do differently?”—which don’t sound accusatory.

**Common Mistake 1**: Coaching the “Mini-Me” Coaching is about helping your team member reach her own potential. Yet, time and time again, managers instead try to coach individuals into the managers’ own image. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to coach your team member into a replica of yourself, or she will become rapidly disengaged from the coaching process.

**Remedy**

Before you craft advice to share with him, start by understanding his strengths and weaknesses and identify how they differ from yours. Take his understanding of the situation into account by asking questions.

**Common Mistake 2**: Thinking Coaching Is Special Time. Managers often overly mystify coaching and as a result make the perennial mistake of waiting for the right time to coach. And, unfortunately, that right time often never comes, because making coaching larger than life makes it unattainable and impractical even for the best of us.

**Remedy**

You do not need to wait for a special time to coach, and not every coaching conversation needs to be a big development discussion with a capital D.

Certainly you should still hold scheduled sit-down discussions with your direct reports to discuss their development goals and a plan of action, but don’t wait for those meetings.

**Common Mistake 3**: Losing Your Patience. Coaching requires patience. It is not about pushing or pulling your team members directly to the specific results you want them to achieve; it’s more like watching on the sidelines during game time, letting them find their own way.

**Remedy**

Embrace the idea that coaching is not a quick-fix proposition. Coaching is a marathon, not a sprint.

Set a time line. Even if you know it will take some time before your direct report has mastered this new skill, it can help you to cite a specific target date by which point you expect her to be independent.

Establish clear milestones. Don’t wait until that target date to check in with your direct report to see how she is doing on the task.

A person must want to be coached in order for it to work, because ultimately the responsibility and ownership of the effort are hers. Start by giving your team member the benefit of the doubt, but as you work with her, quickly assess her coachability.
