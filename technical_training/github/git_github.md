**Mentor Support (IRC Freenode) #OpenHatch**

[Git]()  is a popular revision control system that is used by many open source  projects  [Github](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is  a web-based Git repository hosting service, with  all of the functionality of Git, but with the social features, team management (wikis, issue tracker) and access control.  Github has helped raise the profile of open source projects,  better connecting project with contributor by making repositories more 'more findable and participatory'.


We'll be using Git and Github for our first 'Pull Request' :)
